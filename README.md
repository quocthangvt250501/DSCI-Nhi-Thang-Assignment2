This is the repository for Assignment 2 of the DCSI 6650 course in Reinforcement Learning. Guidance to run the code:

1. Download the jupyter notebook name "Nhi_Thang_Assignment2_Part1.ipynb" for the part 1, the notebook "Nhi_Thang_Assignment2_Part2.ipynb" for the part 2 of the assignment.
2. Upload to Google Collab or any Jupyter notebook with Python support kernel which can run this notebook well.
3. Choose to run all of the notebook, this will takes more time to run as there is many combinations of experiments to run. Or you can choose to run each part that you need to reproduce. For convenience, we alreayd plot and print out all of the results for you to evaluate the code.
